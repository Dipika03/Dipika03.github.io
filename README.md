  </a>
</p>

- Diabetes is a metabolic disease which can results in serious health issue if proper precaution not taken. It causes high blood sugar which can affect the hormone insulin of patient body. Hormone insulin helps body in moving the sugar from the blood to body cells and make sure it stored as energy. With this project we will predict if patient has diabetes or not.

  </a>
</p>

- The world we are living in, is undeniably digital. Since covid 19 there is a tremendous increase in the number of users who prefer online shopping as it is convenient and easy. Most of the people use credit cards for online purchase. Credit Card offers lot of the benefits to users and one of the advantages of credit card is - it allows users to buy something even if they do not have money at that time. This feature has also increased the financial fraud. Although cybersecurity is there and plays an important role in providing digital security, but it is not easy to track down the unusual activity.

  </a>
</p>

- It’s been years since we first heard about the coronavirus. Even with all the facilities available today we are not able to completely get rid of it and still it is a big news. With this project I am analyzing the covid data to get answer to questions. I am performing the deep analysis on California state covid data to see if vaccination reducing the number of covid cases, which county is most effected by covid in California, which county doing well and others.

- Life expectancy means the number of years a person is expected to live based on the statistical average. There is certain variable on which life expectancy depends based on some research. As part this project, I am exploring some of these variables to see the correlation between them and to understand how much these variables effect the life expectancy. These data information is from World Health Organization.

</p>

- According to World Health Organization 1.19 M people dies every year because of road accidents. This number not only include adult but kids and young adults of age between 5-29. Road accidents is one of the major causes of unnatural deaths. To our surprise the rate for unnatural death is increasing every year. As part of this project, I chose the dataset from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments. Using this analysis, we will predict the road accidents severity.
